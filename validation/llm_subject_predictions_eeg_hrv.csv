subject_0_394,Healthy,"Conclusion: No  
Explanation: The EEG summary shows low alpha ratios in several channels, indicating some level of alpha suppression. However, the HRV summary does not show significant suppression (SDNN = 60.74ms), which is above the threshold for concern. Since there is no HRV suppression and only one EEG feature (alpha suppression) without widespread or strong evidence across multiple regions, the criteria for MCI are not met. Therefore, the subject lacks sufficient abnormality for an MCI diagnosis.",healthy,confident
subject_0_399,Healthy,"Conclusion: No  
Explanation: The EEG summary indicates low alpha ratios in multiple frontal and parietal regions, suggesting alpha suppression. However, the HRV summary shows no significant suppression (SDNN = 54.35ms), which does not meet the criteria for HRV suppression. Since there is no HRV suppression and only one strong EEG feature (alpha suppression) without additional supporting features, the evidence is insufficient to classify the case as MCI.",healthy,confident
subject_0_462,Healthy,"Conclusion: No

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates low beta ratios in several channels, suggesting beta suppression, but there is no evidence of alpha suppression or theta elevation. Additionally, the HRV summary shows no significant suppression (SDNN = 70.78ms), which does not support reduced autonomic flexibility. Since neither of the criteria for MCI diagnosis is met, and the findings are not strong or consistent enough, the evidence does not support a diagnosis of MCI.",healthy,confident
subject_0_463,Healthy,"Conclusion: Yes  
Explanation: The case presents with two clear features consistent with MCI: widespread alpha suppression across multiple regions (T8, AF4, O2, P8) and HRV suppression (SDNN = 28.49ms). The presence of these two features meets the criteria for MCI diagnosis according to the ontology reference.",mci,confident
subject_0_468,Healthy,"Conclusion: No  
Explanation: The EEG summary shows low alpha ratios in multiple regions, which suggests alpha suppression. However, there is no HRV suppression (SDNN = 65.70 ms), and the beta suppression is isolated to a single instance. The findings do not meet the criteria for strong evidence of MCI, as there is no convergence of at least two strong features or a single strong EEG feature with HRV suppression. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to classify this case as MCI.",healthy,confident
subject_0_475,Healthy,"Conclusion: Needs clinical review

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates low alpha ratios across multiple regions, suggesting potential alpha suppression. However, the HRV summary does not show significant suppression (SDNN = 34.49ms), which does not meet the criteria for HRV suppression. While there is evidence of alpha suppression, the lack of HRV suppression and the absence of other strong EEG features (such as theta elevation or beta suppression) make the findings borderline. Therefore, the case should be deferred for clinical review to ensure accurate diagnosis.",uncertain,borderline
subject_0_476,Healthy,"Conclusion: No

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates low alpha ratios in several channels, suggesting alpha suppression. However, the HRV summary shows no significant suppression (SDNN = 36.61ms), which does not meet the criteria for HRV suppression. Additionally, there is no mention of theta elevation or beta suppression. Since the evidence does not strongly meet either of the diagnostic rules for MCI, the subject lacks sufficient abnormality for a diagnosis.",healthy,confident
subject_1_397,MCI,"Conclusion: Needs clinical review

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates widespread alpha suppression across multiple frontal regions (AF3, AF4, F3, F7, F8, FC5), which is a strong EEG feature. However, the HRV summary does not show significant suppression (SDNN = 41.39ms), which is above the threshold for concern. While the EEG findings are notable, the lack of HRV suppression means the criteria for a definitive MCI diagnosis are not fully met. Given the strong EEG feature but absence of HRV suppression, the case is borderline and should be deferred for clinical review.",uncertain,borderline
subject_1_455,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes  
Explanation: The case shows strong evidence for MCI as it meets the criteria under the second rule. There is a single strong EEG feature of widespread beta suppression across multiple frontal regions (EEG.AF3, EEG.AF4, EEG.F3, EEG.F4, EEG.F7, and EEG.F8) along with HRV suppression (SDNN = 23.77ms, below the 30ms threshold). This convergence of features supports a classification consistent with MCI.",mci,confident
subject_1_456,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes  
Explanation: The case shows strong evidence for MCI. There is widespread alpha suppression across multiple regions (EEG.F8, EEG.FC5, EEG.P7, EEG.T7) and HRV suppression (SDNN = 20.55ms). This satisfies the second diagnostic rule, where a single strong EEG feature (widespread alpha suppression) is present along with HRV suppression.",mci,confident
subject_1_457,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes

Explanation: The case presents strong evidence for MCI under the first rule. There is clear alpha suppression in multiple frontal regions (EEG.AF3 and EEG.F3) with consistently low alpha ratios, indicating a strong EEG feature. Additionally, HRV suppression is present with an SDNN of 25.03 ms, which is below the 30 ms threshold. These two features together meet the criteria for MCI diagnosis.",mci,confident
subject_1_459,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes  
Explanation: The case presents with strong evidence for MCI. There is widespread beta suppression across multiple EEG channels (EEG.AF3, EEG.F3, EEG.P7, EEG.T7, EEG.AF4, EEG.F4, EEG.F7) with very low beta ratios, indicating significant beta disorganization. Additionally, HRV suppression is present with an SDNN of 28.56 ms, which is below the 30 ms threshold. This combination of a single strong EEG feature (widespread beta suppression) along with HRV suppression meets the criteria for MCI diagnosis.",mci,confident
subject_1_461,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes

Explanation: The case presents strong evidence for MCI under the diagnostic guidance. There is widespread alpha suppression, particularly in multiple frontal regions (EEG.AF3, EEG.F8, EEG.FC6), which is a strong EEG feature. Additionally, there is HRV suppression with an SDNN of 24.81 ms, which is below the 30 ms threshold. The combination of these findings meets the criteria for MCI diagnosis as per the ontology reference.",mci,confident
subject_1_464,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes  
Explanation: The case presents strong evidence for MCI. There is widespread alpha suppression, particularly in multiple frontal (EEG.F3) and parietal (EEG.P8) regions, which is a strong EEG feature. Additionally, there is HRV suppression with an SDNN of 27.69 ms, which is below the 30 ms threshold. This combination of a single strong EEG feature along with HRV suppression meets the criteria for MCI diagnosis.",mci,confident
subject_1_467,MCI,"Conclusion: Yes

Explanation: The case presents with strong evidence for MCI under the diagnostic guidance. There is a clear presence of HRV suppression (SDNN = 27.87ms, below the 30ms threshold) and significant beta suppression across multiple frontal regions (EEG.AF3, EEG.AF4, EEG.F3, EEG.F4) with consistently low beta ratios (0.01). This satisfies the criteria of a single strong EEG feature (widespread beta suppression) along with HRV suppression, supporting a conclusion consistent with MCI.",mci,confident
