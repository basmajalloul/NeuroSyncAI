Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may manifest through a combination of cognitive and subtle motor irregularities. Interpret the subject's condition based on the following:

- EEG markers:
  - Increased Theta power and decreased Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions, are commonly associated with MCI.
  - Suppressed Beta activity may indicate cognitive slowing.

- HRV markers:
  - Reduced heart rate variability (e.g., SDNN < 30 ms) is linked to decreased autonomic regulation and cognitive decline.

- Gait (pose-derived) markers:
  - Healthy gait patterns exhibit wide joint movement ranges, smooth transitions, and consistent acceleration.
  - MCI-related gait changes may include reduced range of motion, higher jerk (abrupt changes in motion), and greater acceleration variability across joints, even without overt motor disability.

Diagnostic Guidance:
- Classify as **MCI** if EEG and/or HRV features indicate cognitive dysfunction, especially when supported by mild motor irregularities.
- Classify as **Control** if all modalities are within normal patterns.
- Classify as **Needs clinical review** if findings are weak, borderline, or inconsistent.

The HRV is within normal limits (SDNN = 36.00 ms), indicating adequate autonomic regulation. However, the gait analysis shows some irregularities: high acceleration standard deviation and jerk values across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, which could suggest subtle motor irregularities. These gait characteristics, while not overtly indicative of MCI, warrant further investigation due to their potential association with mild motor irregularities. Given the normal EEG and HRV findings but the presence of gait anomalies, a clinical review is recommended to ensure a comprehensive assessment.",Needs clinical review,high

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may manifest through a combination of cognitive and subtle motor irregularities. Interpret the subject's condition based on the following:

- EEG markers:
  - Increased Theta power and decreased Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions, are commonly associated with MCI.
  - Suppressed Beta activity may indicate cognitive slowing.

- HRV markers:
  - Reduced heart rate variability (e.g., SDNN < 30 ms) is linked to decreased autonomic regulation and cognitive decline.

- Gait (pose-derived) markers:
  - Healthy gait patterns exhibit wide joint movement ranges, smooth transitions, and consistent acceleration.
  - MCI-related gait changes may include reduced range of motion, higher jerk (abrupt changes in motion), and greater acceleration variability across joints, even without overt motor disability.

Diagnostic Guidance:
- Classify as **MCI** if EEG and/or HRV features indicate cognitive dysfunction, especially when supported by mild motor irregularities.
- Classify as **Control** if all modalities are within normal patterns.

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates that both Alpha and Theta power levels are within normal ranges, with very low Theta/Alpha and Theta/Beta ratios, suggesting no significant cognitive dysfunction. The HRV summary shows a normal SDNN value of 34.00 ms, indicating adequate autonomic regulation and no signs of cognitive decline.

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may manifest through a combination of cognitive and subtle motor irregularities. Interpret the subject's condition based on the following:

- EEG markers:
  - Increased Theta power and decreased Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions, are commonly associated with MCI.
  - Suppressed Beta activity may indicate cognitive slowing.

- HRV markers:
  - Reduced heart rate variability (e.g., SDNN < 30 ms) is linked to decreased autonomic regulation and cognitive decline.

- Gait (pose-derived) markers:
  - Healthy gait patterns exhibit wide joint movement ranges, smooth transitions, and consistent acceleration.
  - MCI-related gait changes may include reduced range of motion, higher jerk (abrupt changes in motion), and greater acceleration variability across joints, even without overt motor disability.

Explanation: The EEG summary indicates a global reduction in Alpha power, which is a marker commonly associated with MCI. Although Theta levels are normal, the elevated Theta/Alpha ratio (3.15) suggests a shift towards patterns seen in cognitive impairment. The HRV summary shows significant suppression (SDNN = 12.54 ms), indicating decreased autonomic regulation, which is linked to cognitive decline. The gait analysis reveals increased variability and jerk in joint movements, particularly in the hip, knee, and ankle, which are consistent with subtle motor irregularities associated with MCI. These findings across all three modalities support a classification of MCI.",MCI,high
trial8_MCI,MCI,"
Multimodal Ontology Reference:
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may manifest through a combination of cognitive and subtle motor irregularities. Interpret the subject's condition based on the following:

- EEG markers:
  - Increased Theta power and decreased Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions, are commonly associated with MCI.
  - Suppressed Beta activity may indicate cognitive slowing.

- HRV markers:
  - Reduced heart rate variability (e.g., SDNN < 30 ms) is linked to decreased autonomic regulation and cognitive decline.

- Gait (pose-derived) markers:
  - Healthy gait patterns exhibit wide joint movement ranges, smooth transitions, and consistent acceleration.
  - MCI-related gait changes may include reduced range of motion, higher jerk (abrupt changes in motion), and greater acceleration variability across joints, even without overt motor disability.

Diagnostic Guidance:
- Classify as **MCI** if EEG and/or HRV features indicate cognitive dysfunction, especially when supported by mild motor irregularities.
- Classify as **Control** if all modalities are within normal patterns.
- Classify as **Needs clinical review** if findings are weak, borderline, or inconsistent.

Use all three modalities in combination to support a holistic evaluation.
